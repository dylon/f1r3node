# Rholang

Rholang is a concurrent programming language, with a focus on message-passing and formally modeled by the ρ-calculus, a reflective, higher-order extension of the π-calculus. It is designed to be used to implement protocols and "smart contracts" on a general-purpose blockchain, but could be used in other settings as well.

The language is still in the early stages of development. Currently we have a working interpreter for the language. It should be considered an early preview of the language.

This is a direct port of the `rholang` Scala library to Rust. The original Scala library code can be found [here](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/tree/dev/rholang).

## Command Line Interface

The Rholang CLI provides a command-line interface for executing Rholang programs and compiling them to various formats.

### Building the CLI

From the project root, build the Rholang CLI:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin rholang-cli
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/rholang-cli`

### Running the CLI

You can run the CLI in two ways:

#### Option 1: Using `cargo run` (from project root)

```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- [OPTIONS] [FILES]...
```

#### Option 2: Using the built binary

After building, you can run the binary directly:
```bash
./target/release/rholang-cli [OPTIONS] [FILES]...
```

#### Options

- `--binary` - outputs binary protobuf serialization
- `--text` - outputs textual protobuf serialization
- `--quiet` - don't print tuplespace after evaluation
- `--unmatched-sends-only` - only print unmatched sends after evaluation
- `--data-dir <DATA_DIR>` - Path to data directory
- `--map-size <MAP_SIZE>` - Map size (in bytes) [default: 1073741824]
- `-h, --help` - Print help
- `-V, --version` - Print version

#### Examples

**From the project root:**

Evaluate a Rholang file:
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- rholang/examples/stdout.rho
# or with the built binary:
./target/release/rholang-cli rholang/examples/stdout.rho
```

Start the REPL (interactive mode):
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli
# or with the built binary:
./target/release/rholang-cli
```

Compile to binary format:
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- --binary rholang/examples/stdout.rho
```

Compile to text format:
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- --text rholang/examples/stdout.rho
```

Evaluate quietly (no storage output):
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- --quiet rholang/examples/stdout.rho
```

Show only unmatched sends:
```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- --unmatched-sends-only rholang/examples/stdout.rho
```

**From the `rholang` directory:**

```bash
cargo run --bin rholang-cli -- examples/stdout.rho
# or with the built binary:
../target/release/rholang-cli examples/stdout.rho
```

## Development

To build the `rholang` Rust library, run `cargo build --release -p rholang`
  - `cargo build --profile dev -p rholang` will build the library in debug mode

### Testing

#### Rust

To run all tests: `cargo test`

Run all tests in release mode: `cargo test --release`

To run specific test file: `cargo test --test <test_file_name>`

To run specific test in specific folder: `cargo test --test <test_folder_name>::<test_file_name>`

#### Scala

The following tests all use `rholang-rust` and must be run at root project directory:

- Run Casper Genesis tests: `sbt "compile ;casper/testOnly coop.rchain.casper.genesis.*"`
- Run Casper Rholang tests: `sbt ";casper/testOnly coop.rchain.casper.batch1.MultiParentCasperRholangSpec"`
- Run Casper Block tests: `sbt ";casper/testOnly coop.rchain.casper.addblock.MultiParentCasperAddBlockSpec"`
- Run Casper Propose test: `sbt ";casper/testOnly coop.rchain.casper.addblock.ProposerSpec"`
- Run Casper Contract tests: `sbt "compile ;casper/testOnly coop.rchain.casper.genesis.contracts.*"`

## What's working, what's broken:
### The bad
In general:
  * Guarded patterns for channel receive (e.g. `for (@x <- y if x > 0)`) don't work.
  * 0-arity send and receive is currently broken.
  * We don't pre-evaluate match cases. So matching 7 + 8 as a pattern currently doesn't work. Instead, you must match against 15.
### The good
Several working examples have been included in the examples directory, and the examples in the [Rholang tutorial](https://github.com/rchain/rchain/blob/dev/docs/rholang/rholangtut.md) also work. If you run into something that doesn't work, check the bugtracker to see if it's a known issue, and if not, feel free to a GitHub issue. We want Rholang to be a useful programming environment.
